# Pterodactyl-Install-Scripts
A set of scripts to make deploying Pterodactyl Panel and Wings easier. Most of these scripts contain optimizations for a fresh debian install combined with the installation and configuration steps copied from the Pterodactyl and Wings installtion guide, adapted where needed for Debian.

The usage would be to install Debian, and then download and run the scripts to automate deploying Pterodactyl and Wings.

These scripts are fire-and-forget. All install customization must be done by manually editing the scripts.

These are intended for my personal use, but others may find them useful.
