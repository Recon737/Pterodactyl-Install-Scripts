# Pterodactyl-Install-Scripts
A set of scripts to make deploying Pterodactyl Panel and Wings easier. Most of these scripts contain optimizations for a fresh debian install and the installationa and configuration steps copied from the Pterodactyl and Wings installtion guide, adapted where needed for Debian.

The usage would be to install Debian, and then download and run the scripts to automate deploying Pterodactyl and Wings.
